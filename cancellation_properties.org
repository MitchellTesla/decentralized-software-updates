* Properties avoiding wrong cancellation

** Property 1
*IF* a consensus update proposal /p_{1}/ is canceled \\
*THEN*
  - One of the following conditions shall be satisfied:
     - Proposal /p_{1}/ supersedes a version that is lower than the current version of the blockchain; *OR*

     - A cancellation proposal to cancel /p_{1}/ is approved such that:
         - The current slot is less than /2k/ blocks before the end of the "current epoch" *OR* \\
         - Proposal /p_{1}/ has *NOT* gathered enough endorsing stake /2k/ blocks before the end of the "current epoch"; *OR*

     - Another parameter/consensus update proposal /p_{2}/ with the same version as /p_{1}/ is approved such that:
         - Proposal /p_{1}/ is also approved at the current slot *AND*
         - Proposal /p_{2}/ has a higher approval stake than /p_{1}/ *OR* \\
           Both /p_{1}/ and /p_{2}/ has the same approval stake but /p_{2}/ has the greatest id; *OR*

     - Another parameter/consensus update proposal /p_{2}/ with the same version as /p_{1}/ is approved such that:
         - Proposal /p_{1}/ was approved at a previous slot *AND*
         - The current slot is less than /2k/ blocks before the end of the "current epoch" *OR* \\
           Proposal /p_{1}/ has *NOT* gathered enough endorsing stake /2k/ blocks before the end of the "current epoch"; *OR*

     - The safety lag of proposal /p_{1}/ expires at the next epoch such that:
        - The current slot is /2k/ blocks before the end of the current epoch *AND*
        - Proposal /p_{1}/ has *NOT* gathered enough endorsing stake.


** Property 2
  *IF* a parameter update proposal /p_{1}/ is canceled \\
  *THEN*
   - One of the following conditions shall be satisfied:
     - Proposal /p_{1}/ supersedes a version that is lower than the current version of the blockchain; *OR*

     - A cancellation proposal to cancel /p_{1}/ is approved such that:
         - The current slot is less than /2k/ blocks before the end of the "current epoch"; *OR*

     - Another parameter/consensus update proposal /p_{2}/ with the same version as /p_{1}/ is approved such that:
         - Proposal /p_{1}/ is also approved at the current slot *AND*
         - Proposal /p_{2}/ has a higher approval stake than /p_{1}/ *OR* \\
           Both /p_{1}/ and /p_{2}/ has the same approval stake but /p_{2}/ has the greatest id; *OR*

     - Another parameter/consensus update proposal /p_{2}/ with the same version as /p_{1}/ is approved such that:
         - Proposal /p_{1}/ was approved at a previous slot *AND*
         - The current slot is less than /2k/ blocks before the end of the "current epoch".
