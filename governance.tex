\section{Update Governance}
\subsection*{Voting Protocol}
\begin{itemize}
\item A voting protocol must be proposed that will enable an update consensus on. I.e., a community agreement on the priorities of the Update Proposals. 
\item The protocol must be secure and provide an incentivization scheme that will guarantee safety for the voting results, in an open and truly decentralized setting.
\item Need to define the vote transaction
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Delegation Protocol}
\begin{itemize}
\item A voting delegation protocol must be proposed to ensure voting for proposals even when there exist stakeholders that are not at a position to vote for themselves and need to delegate their voting right to some other user. 
\item Also we need to describe if there is any connection of this delegation with the mining delegation.
\item Also, what happens when a stakeholder is not live during update proposal voting
\end{itemize}
