\section{Deployment / Activation}
\subsection*{Update Activation}
What is an activation event and how do we handle it. When should it be triggered, how is it applied and how do we record it?

How do we ensure that Participants who have been inactive when some update was deployed are  prevented from getting locked out of the system?

Also, deployment/activation time must vary according to the type of change. We see the following ''change categories'':
\begin{itemize}
\item Bug-fix vs. Change Request
\item Consensus Protocol impact vs. No Impact
\item High severity vs. Low severity
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Rollbacks}
How can we smoothly rollback an update, in the case of a problem?

\subsection*{Hard/Soft/Velvet forks and Sidechains}
\begin{itemize}
\item When is a soft fork acceptable?
\item When is a hard fork acceptable?
\item When should a velvet fork be used?
\item When should the sidechain mechanism be used?
\item Basic Research results on sidechains for PoS ledgers
\item Sidechains and governance in the presence of multiple updates. Can we have multiple “update sidechains” running in parallel?
\end{itemize}
