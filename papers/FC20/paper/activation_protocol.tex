\subsection{Candidate Protocols for PoS Ledgers}

Let $\ledger_1$ be the ledger that the parties are currently running and $\ledger_2$ be the new ledger.
In the description of our update protocol we assume that there is a time $t^\upd$ such that $\asmp_2[t]$ holds for all $t\geq t^\upd$.\footnote{We could require $\asmp_2$ to
hold only for bounded interval of time and our protocol would still work if this interval is large enough.} To ensure that $\asmp_2$ actually holds we could use
the approach proposed in Sec.~\ref{se:u}. 
We also assume that the parties in $\activep$ knows an index $j$ such that when the $j$-th block is added to the state of $\ledger_1$ than $\asmp_2$ holds. 
\mnote{say more on that.} Each party $P_i\in\activep$ at time $t^\upd$ executes the following steps

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Run $\ledger_1$ until the $(j+k)$-th block appears in $\ledger^{P_i}[t]$ for some $t\geq t^\upd$.
	\item Start running $\ledger_2$ in order to extend the state of $\ledger_1$ starting from the $(j+k)$-th block.
\end{enumerate}
