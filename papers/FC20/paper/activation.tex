\section{Defining a Secure Update System} \label{secureupdate}
We have seen that upon the approval of a UP, users start installing the software update (i.e., upgrade) and wait for the activation of the changes. We call the time period from the approval of a UP until the actual activation of the changes in the blockchain system as the \emph{activation lag}. In order, to enable a fast and flexible software updating mechanism, we should minimize the activation lag, which is in turn determined by the \emph{adoption threshold}. These are the topics to be discussed in this section.

\subsection{The Activation of Changes}
%In the lifecycle section, we have described how a software update, after being voted as a SIP, it is submitted again during the approval phase in the form of a UP (source code bundled with metadata), in order to be approved. We make the assumption 
In our protocol, we assume that if a UP is approved, then all (honest) stake will eventually upgrade. However, if we want to have a minimum activation lag, then we cannot wait until all the stake upgrades, to kick-off activation. What is the minimum necessary percent of stake to have upgraded, before the actual activation of the change takes place, in order to avoid a chain split? The \emph{adoption threshold} is used in the activation phase and corresponds exactly to the minimum percent of stake that is necessary to have signaled activation readiness, before the actual activation of a software update takes place. It is essentially a synchronization point that ensures that a sufficient percent of stake has upgraded and thus it is safe to actually activate the changes. It is therefore a guard against chain splits. Please note that the adoption threshold is only relevant for software updates that impact the consensus protocol. For all other software updates the activation can take place immediately after the upgrade.

Let us assume that the adoption threshold of our software updates protocol is called $\tau_A$. %In order to enable update policies, we need to be able to adjust $\tau_A$ based on each software update's metadata. 
What would be the appropriate values for $\tau_A$? Take into account that by adjusting the value of $\tau_A$, we risk to cause a chain split for two distinct reasons: a) A too-low value of $\tau_A$ might result to a \emph{too-early activation}, which will result to the partition of the honest stake in two and a potential chain split\footnote{A partition of the honest stake also undermines the security of the underlying consensus protocol which assumes a minimum threshold $x$ of honest stake.}  and b) a too-high value of $\tau_A$ might result to a \emph{too-late activation}, giving the opportunity to adversaries to block an activation by refusing to signal. We call this a \emph{Denial of Activation} attack. %Clearly the former is a safety problem, while the latter is a security problem. 
What is the allowable range of values for $\tau_A$, in order to mitigate these risks?

In order to avoid both of the two problems described above, the adoption threshold $\tau_A$ should take values in the range $x \leq \tau_A \leq h_a$, where $x$ is the theoretical honest stake threshold of the underlying consensus protocol and $h_a$ is the \emph{actual} percent of honest stake (of course $h_a \geq x$). In addition, we assume that the honest stake that has signaled, when the threshold is met, is at least $x$ ($S_{honest} \geq x$) , i.e., at least equal to the honest stake threshold of the consensus protocol. The rationale of this result is explained in the appendix \ref{appxadoption}, due to space limitations.

A possible attack in the case where $x \leq \tau_A \leq h_a$ is the adversary to hurry to signal for a software update, so that the threshold $\tau_A$ is met, without (at least) $x$ honest stake to have enough time to complete the upgrade (i.e., $S_{honest} < x$). Thus a too-early activation will take place and the honest stake will be partitioned for some time, risking a chain split and also running the consensus protocol without the $x$ honest stake assumption.

Intuitively, in order to prevent this type of attack, we need to give more time to honest stake to upgrade, since we have assumed that all honest stake will eventually upgrade. This is especially true for difficult to deploy software updates, or hard fork type of changes, where the risk of a chain split is greater. A high value of $\tau_A$ would help towards this end, which means that our update policy, would ideally adjust the adoption threshold close to $h_a$ (i.e., to the actual percent of honest stake). Of course, we do not know $h_a$ exactly and we should base it on some sort of estimation. What if we could delay the activation of changes, even though the $\tau_A$ threshold has been met? This is the topic of the next subsection.
