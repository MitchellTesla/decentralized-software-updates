* Questions and Clarifications on Endorsement and Cancellation
** Question 1
Does the safety lag corresponds to a particular end of an epoch or does it specify the number of epochs in which endorsement can be made ? \\
Indeed, the specification gives the impression that a safety lag
corresponds to a specific epoch, or is there a conversion (not explicitly stated) performed when the
consensus proposal enters its endorsement period ?

** Question 2
If the safety lag does NOT correspond to a particular end of an epoch and the "ending epoch"
for an endorsement is computed only when a consensus proposal $p_{1}$ enters its endorsement period, \\
then we may have the following situation:
   - $p_{1}$ enters its endorsement period in epoch 10 (with ending epoch set to 15);
   - Epoch 14 is reached and $p_{1}$ has still not gathered enough endorsement;
   - Another proposal $p_{2}$ with a version lower than $p_{1}$ is approved but 2k blocks before the end of epoch 14,
   - $p_{1}$ is returned back to the activation queue;
   - Proposal $p_{2}$ is canceled at epoch 19 since it has NOT gathered enough endorsing stake (or is canceled explicitly);
   - Proposal $p_{1}$ enters once again its endorsement period (with ending epoch set to 24).

 In a sense, the endorsement period for $p_{1}$ may be extended deliberately by anyone wanting
 to see $p_{1}$ get endorsed via the submission of a proposal (or any number of necessary proposals) \\
 with a version lower than $p_{1}$ that he/she knows will never get endorsed (e.g., due to external factors, rumors about security flaws, etc).

** Question 3
What is the behavior when an endorsing stake is received for an update proposal not in its endorsement period ? \\
 $\hspace{1ex}$ i.e., Is it rejected or is it simply not considered when the effective tally takes place.

** Question 4
Are the nodes (clients) notified when the proposal they endorsed is returned back to the activation queue ?
Are they aware that the endorsements have been discarded ?

** Question 5
Is implicit and explicit cancellation of a proposal notify to the community ?
