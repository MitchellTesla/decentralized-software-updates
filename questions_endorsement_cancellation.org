* Questions and Clarifications on Endorsement and Cancellation
** Question 1
Does the safety lag corresponds to a particular end of an epoch or does it specify the number of epochs
in which endorsement can be made ? Indeed, the specification gives the impression that a safety lag
corresponds to a specific epoch, or is there a conversion (not explicitly stated) performed when the
consensus proposal enters its endorsement period ?

** Question 2
If the safety lag does NOT correspond to a particular end of an epoch and that the ending epoch
for an endorsement is computed only when a consensus proposal /p1/ enters its endorsement period,
then we may have the following situation:
   - /p1/ enters its endorsement period in epoch 10 (with ending epoch set to 15)
   - Epoch 14 is reached and /p1/ has still not gathered enough endorsement
   - Another proposal /p2/ with a version lower than /p1/ is approved but 2k blocks before the end of epoch 14
   - /p1/ is returned back to the activation queue
   - Proposal /p2/ is canceled at epoch 19 since it has not gathered enough endorsing stake (or is canceled explicitly)
   - Proposal /p1/ enters once again its endorsement period (with ending epoch set to 24)

 In a sense, the endorsement period for /p1/ may be extended deliberately by anyone wanting
 to see /p1/ get endorsed via the submission of a proposal (or any number of necessary proposals) with a version lower
 than /p1/ that he/she knows will never get endorsed (e.g., due to external factors, rumors about security flaws, etc).

** Question 3
What is the behavior when an endorsement is received for an update proposal not in its endorsement period ?
 i.e., Is it rejected or is it simply not considered when the effective tally takes place.

** Question 4
 - Are the nodes (clients) notified when the proposal they endorsed is returned back to the activation queue,
   thus knowing that the endorsements have been discarded ?

** Question 5
 - Is implicit and explicit cancellation of a proposal notify to the community ?
