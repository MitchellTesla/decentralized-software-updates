\section{Ledger Enhancements}

\subsection*{Recording the History of Updates}
We use the ledger as the “Single version of the truth” for updates.
We need to propose how the ledger is enhanced in order to accommodate the new events:
\begin{itemize}
\item Update Proposals
\item Votes
\item Delegation
\item Update Activation
\item Other?
\end{itemize}
Is only the SL layer affected? What about the CL layer (smart contracts)?

\subsection*{Update Proposals}
\begin{itemize}
\item New transaction type. 
\item Issued Updates. 
\item Revealed Updates.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Update Proposal Lifecycle}
State diagram of the various states in the life of an update proposal. What are the valid states?
