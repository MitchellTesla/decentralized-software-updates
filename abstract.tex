\subsection*{Abstract}
Software updates are a synonym to software evolution and thus are ubiquitous and inevitable to any blockchain platform. In this paper, we propose a general framework for software updates in distributed ledger systems. Our framework is primarily focused on permission-less stake-based blockchains and aims at providing a solid set of enhancements, covering the full spectrum of a blockchain system, in order to ensure a secure and decentralised update mechanism for a public ledger. Our main contribution is the proposal of a logical architecture that enables a smooth incorporation of updates into all components of a blockchain system. Moreover, we drill down to each component of the architecture and propose specific enhancements and changes. In addition, we describe in detail new components such as the governance module and the update-logic module. For the former, we propose a voting protocol, in order to enable a decentralized update consensus and for the latter, we show how we can implement different update policies for each type of update based on a rich set of update metadata. Finally, we implement our ideas in a prototype update system for the Cardano blockchain and discuss implementation issues and validation results.
